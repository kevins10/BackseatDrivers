# Backseat Drivers
Backseat Drivers is a carpool app tailored specifically for SFU students. 

Our goal is to save students time and money by providing a platform to coordinate carpool rides to school. Through our app, students will have the option to either host or join rides to any of SFUâ€™s three major campuses.

Our app will allow students to:
1. Sign-in and create a personal profile
2. Post available rides and ride requests
3. View carpool routes with a map API
4. Receive upcoming trip reminder notifications
